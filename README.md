# Python Minesweeper Executable
This branch contains the *executable file* to run the Minesweeper game.

> Download the zip folder of this branch to play the game

Note: You must set up python and pygame with a compiler to edit + run the code locally. This build folder has no 'minesweeper.py' file that you can edit.
